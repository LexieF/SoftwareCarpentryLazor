import laser_pathway
def check(board_state):
	# check the beam of the lazor
	# check if the destination point is on the beam of the lazor
	# if the beam meets all the required points, return True
	# if not, return False and it goes back to the 
	# expansion function 

for i in laser_pathway:
    if i = points:
    return True
